In this study, we explore the potential of different techniques in estimating the age of abalones, traditionally determined by counting the number of rings on their shells. This conventional method is not only time-consuming but also demands specialized expertise. Our approach leverages the Abalone dataset, which includes various physical measurements of abalones. We employ multiple linear regression with Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection, alongside Lasso and Ridge regressions, to analyze these measurements. Additionally, we implement a Random Forest model to enhance predictive accuracy. The primary goal is to predict the number of rings ('Rings'), which directly correlates with the age of the abalones, using these physical measurements as explanatory variables. Our study aims to streamline the age estimation process of abalones, making it more efficient and less reliant on expert intervention. \\
